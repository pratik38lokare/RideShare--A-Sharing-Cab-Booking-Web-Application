                <p className="mb-4">
                    At RideShare, we believe in making travel more affordable, sociable, and convenient. Our community-based travel network connects millions of members looking to share rides, making it easier for everyone to reach their destinations while reducing the environmental impact of travel. By leveraging technology, we aim to fill empty seats on the road, creating a more sustainable and connected world.

                <h3 style={{ color: '#007BFF' }} className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How It All Started</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The idea for RideShare was born out of a shared experience among our group during the Diwali festival. Each year, we faced significant challenges trying to get home to our families amidst the heavy traffic and limited transportation options. Frustrated by the difficulties of travel during this busy time, we realized there had to be a better way to connect people who were traveling in the same direction.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    This realization sparked our vision for a platform that would make travel easier and more accessible for everyone. We came together as a team to develop RideShare, a solution that not only addresses the challenges of holiday travel but also fosters a sense of community among travelers. Our goal is to ensure that no one has to face the journey alone, especially during times when family reunions are most important.
                </p>
